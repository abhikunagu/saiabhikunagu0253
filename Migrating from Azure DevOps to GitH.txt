Migrating from Azure DevOps to GitHub involves multiple stages, including code migration, pipeline migration, permissions, and project configurations. Here's a full breakdown of the coding process involved in the migration:

1. Planning and Assessment
Evaluate existing setup: Review your Azure DevOps repositories, pipelines, boards, artifacts, and other features to assess the scope of migration.
Project Mapping: Map Azure DevOps services (Repos, Pipelines, Boards, etc.) to their GitHub equivalents (GitHub Repos, Actions, Issues, etc.).
Access management: Identify how permissions and roles are currently set in Azure DevOps and plan the equivalent permissions in GitHub (e.g., GitHub Teams).
2. Repository Migration
Clone Azure DevOps Repos:
Clone your existing Azure DevOps repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_git/{repo}
cd {repo}
Create GitHub Repository:
Create a new repository in GitHub using the GitHub interface or CLI:
bash
Copy code
gh repo create {repo-name} --public/private
Push Code to GitHub:
Change the remote URL to GitHub and push the code:
bash
Copy code
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/{org}/{repo-name}.git
git push origin --all
git push origin --tags
3. Pipeline Migration
Azure DevOps Pipelines to GitHub Actions:
Understand Existing Pipelines: Export or review the YAML-based Azure Pipelines or classic pipelines.
Convert to GitHub Actions: Convert Azure Pipeline YAML configuration to GitHub Actions workflows.
Example Azure Pipelines YAML:
yaml
Copy code
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main
jobs:
  - job: Build
    pool:
      vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
    steps:
      - script: echo Hello, world!
        displayName: 'Run a one-line script'
Equivalent GitHub Actions Workflow:
yaml
Copy code
name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo Hello, world!
Testing Workflows: Test GitHub Actions workflows to ensure they mirror Azure Pipelines functionality.
Secrets Management: Migrate pipeline secrets from Azure DevOps to GitHub Secrets.
Store them in GitHub under Settings -> Secrets and Variables.
4. Build and Release Artifacts
Artifact Management: If you are using Azure DevOps Artifacts (NuGet, npm, etc.), configure GitHub Packages to handle artifact storage.
Publish Artifacts in GitHub Actions: Use actions to upload/download artifacts.
Example to upload a build artifact:
yaml
Copy code
- name: Upload a Build Artifact
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: build-output
    path: path/to/build/output
5. CI/CD Pipeline Execution
Ensure that the build/test/release flows in GitHub Actions work as expected:
Run workflows for building, testing, and deploying your application.
Monitor and debug any issues during the transition.
6. Work Item and Issue Migration
Work Items (Azure DevOps Boards): If you need to migrate Azure Boards items (like epics, stories, tasks), you can manually move these or use tools like Azure DevOps to GitHub Migration tool.
GitHub Issues: Create GitHub issues based on the Azure DevOps work items.
You can also use APIs or third-party tools to automate this process.
7. Permissions and Access
User and Group Mapping: Migrate users from Azure DevOps to GitHub organizations and teams.
Set up permissions according to your GitHub organization’s needs (Admin, Write, Read permissions).
8. Testing and Validation
Dry Runs: Conduct dry runs of critical workflows and pipelines to ensure successful migration.
Validation: Confirm code integrity, pipeline functionality, access controls, and artifact configurations.
9. Cutover and Finalization
Once the GitHub repository, pipelines, and permissions are validated, officially switch development operations to GitHub.
Communication: Inform the team about the changes and provide instructions on how to access and work in GitHub.
10. Post-Migration Activities
Backup Azure DevOps Data: Make sure you have backups of the Azure DevOps data in case you need to refer back.
Decommissioning: If everything works well in GitHub, you can begin decommissioning Azure DevOps or repurposing it for other needs.
Tools for Migration
GitHub Migration Tool: Automates some parts of migrating repositories, issues, and permissions.
Third-party Tools: Such as Git-Tfs or GitHub’s Azure DevOps Importer for smooth transitions.
By following these steps, you can effectively move from Azure DevOps to GitHub while ensuring minimal disruptions to your CI/CD process.

Migrating from GitHub to Azure DevOps involves several steps, including migrating repositories, CI/CD pipelines, work items (issues), and permissions. Below is a full coding process involved in migrating from GitHub to Azure DevOps.

1. Planning and Assessment
Evaluate existing setup: Review your GitHub repositories, workflows (GitHub Actions), issues, and any other assets such as packages.
Mapping to Azure DevOps: Map GitHub services to Azure DevOps equivalents (e.g., GitHub Issues to Azure DevOps Boards, GitHub Actions to Azure Pipelines, GitHub Secrets to Azure DevOps Library).
Identify dependencies: Determine any third-party integrations or services that may need migration.
2. Repository Migration
Clone GitHub Repositories:
Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/{org}/{repo}.git
cd {repo}
Create Azure DevOps Repository:
Create a new repository in Azure DevOps under your project:
Navigate to Repos in Azure DevOps.
Select New Repository, then choose a name and create.
Set the new Azure DevOps repository as the remote for your local repository:
bash
Copy code
git remote set-url origin https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_git/{repo}
git push origin --all
git push origin --tags
3. Pipeline Migration
GitHub Actions to Azure Pipelines:
Review GitHub Actions Workflows: Identify all workflows running on GitHub Actions that need to be migrated.
Convert GitHub Actions to Azure Pipelines YAML:
Example GitHub Actions YAML:
yaml
Copy code
name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Hello, world!"
Equivalent Azure Pipelines YAML:
yaml
Copy code
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main
pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
steps:
  - script: echo "Hello, world!"
Set up Azure Pipelines:
Go to Pipelines in Azure DevOps.
Select New Pipeline, choose your repository, and create a pipeline using YAML.
Add the equivalent pipeline YAML and save it.
Testing and Debugging:
Run the pipeline in Azure DevOps and ensure it behaves the same way as the GitHub Actions workflow.
Address any discrepancies or issues.
4. Secrets and Variables
Migrate GitHub Secrets to Azure DevOps Library:
In GitHub, secrets are stored in repository settings. You will need to migrate these to Azure DevOps using the Pipeline Library feature.
Steps:
Navigate to Pipelines → Library in Azure DevOps.
Create a new variable group and add the required secrets.
Reference these secrets in your Azure Pipelines YAML:
yaml
Copy code
variables:
  - group: 'my-variable-group'
steps:
  - script: echo $(my-secret)
5. Work Item Migration (GitHub Issues to Azure DevOps Boards)
Manual Migration:
You can manually create work items in Azure DevOps Boards corresponding to GitHub Issues.
Automated Migration (Optional):
Tools like GitHub Issue Migrator or API-based scripts can automate this process.
Example of creating an issue using Azure DevOps REST API:
bash
Copy code
curl -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_apis/wit/workitems/$Issue?api-version=6.0 \
-d '[
  {
    "op": "add",
    "path": "/fields/System.Title",
    "value": "Migrated issue title"
  },
  {
    "op": "add",
    "path": "/fields/System.Description",
    "value": "Details about the issue"
  }
]'
6. Artifact Migration
GitHub Packages to Azure Artifacts:
If you are using GitHub Packages (e.g., npm, NuGet), you will need to move them to Azure Artifacts.
Example for moving npm packages:
Publish packages from your GitHub repository:
bash
Copy code
npm publish --registry https://npm.pkg.github.com/{owner}
Publish to Azure Artifacts:
bash
Copy code
npm publish --registry https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_packaging/{feed}/npm/registry/
7. Access and Permissions Migration
GitHub Teams to Azure DevOps Groups:
GitHub uses Teams for managing user permissions. In Azure DevOps, use Security Groups to manage access to repositories, pipelines, and boards.
Steps:
In Azure DevOps, go to Project Settings → Permissions.
Add users to the appropriate groups (e.g., Contributors, Readers, Build Administrators).
8. Testing and Validation
Repository Verification: Check that the code in Azure DevOps matches what was in GitHub.
Pipeline Testing: Test all migrated pipelines and ensure they work correctly in Azure Pipelines.
Work Item and Issue Review: Validate that all critical work items from GitHub Issues are successfully migrated to Azure Boards.
Access Control: Ensure that permissions are set up correctly in Azure DevOps and that teams can access the repositories and pipelines.
9. Cutover and Finalization
Switch Development to Azure DevOps:
Once everything is validated, inform the team that development will now be done in Azure DevOps.
Update CI/CD Triggers: Update Git triggers to start pipelines on Azure DevOps rather than GitHub.
Example:
yaml
Copy code
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main
Communication: Notify stakeholders of the migration and provide any necessary documentation or training for working with Azure DevOps.
10. Post-Migration Clean-up
Decommission GitHub Workflows: Disable GitHub Actions workflows that are no longer in use.
Backup and Archival: Keep a backup of GitHub repositories and artifacts for historical purposes.
Monitor and Support: Continue monitoring Azure DevOps for issues and ensure a smooth transition.
Tools for Migration
Azure DevOps Migration Tools: Automate parts of the migration such as issues or work items.
Git-Tfs: Use to migrate Git repositories if you were using Git-Tfs.
Azure DevOps REST API: For automating pipeline, repo, and issue migrations.
By following these steps, you can effectively migrate from GitHub to Azure DevOps while ensuring minimal disruptions to your development workflows.
